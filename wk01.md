## Can Fascism Take Root in the US?

- fascism \(\rightarrow\) ultranationalism
- nation defined with identities and leader
- fascist politics \(\neq\) fascist state
- signs of fascisization
  - normalization of conspiracies
  - cult of personality
  - otherization
- hitler influenced by jim crow, KKK, etc.

## This is the Face of Fascism in the US

- Charlottesville \(\equiv\) protests in DE 1930

## The Rise of Fascism on American College Campuses

- fascism: denial of free speech
- missou reporter pushed around and denied access
- college students taught to be anti-nationalist
- constant victimization

## Paxton - _The Anatomy of Fascism_

- fascism: ideology
  - fascist = espouser of fascism
- "-isms" traditionally formed through debate, founded on philosophical framework
- fascism bootstrapped in era of mass politics
  - ø founded on philosphical truth
- truth \(\rightarrow\) whatever advanced the state
- ultimate fascist aesthetic experience: war
- power \(\gg\) doctrine
- anti-intellectual
- liberals torn between socialists and fascists
- fascism ø exported

## Hitler - _Mein Kampf_

- "strong will survive"
- blind faith
- basically just hitler's plan

## Orwell - "What is Fascism?"

- fascist states (e.g. DE, IT) differ wildly from each other
- fascism is a loaded/meaningless term
- conservatives: crypto-fascists
- socialists: fascist collaborators
- communists: equivalent to fascists
- trotskyists: crypto-fascists
- catholics: _literally_ fascists apparently
- anti-war: making things easier for nazis
- pro-war: war = fascism
- nationalists: one step away from fascism
- term is heavily desensitized and normalized

## Albright - _Fascism: A Warning_

- fascism = colloquially any form of authority
- loses meaning

## Passmore - "'A and not A': What is Fascism?"

- example picking of fascism ø hold
- slightly more effective to define in terms of oppositions

### Marxist

- Communist International (1935): logical conclusion of finance capitalism
- currently defined in terms of Foucauldian eugenicism
- demonstrates material motivation for fascism
- fascism \(\nRightarrow\) capitalism

### Weberian

- fascism originated from pre-industrial ruling class
- conservative elites became desperate to hold on to power
- fascism = regressive/antimodern

### Totalitarianism

- defined as a single ruling party with no rights
- failed to describe DE/IT fascism
- **paligenetic**: "rebirth from the ashes"
- political religions theory: fascism = secular religion
- does not account for individual choice

### Revolution + Reaction

- multiple inconsistencies in definitions
  - emphasizes some aspects, ignores others
- also difficult to choose a quintessential example
- must be approached case-by-case

## Mussolini - "The Doctrine of Fascism"

- fascism requires total devotion to the nation
- discourages an "easy life"
- fascism is anti-individualistic
- requires constant progression
- supported by the working class
- does not have room for pacifism
- suicide is for cowards
- > It is not essential to the existence of reason that all should be familiar with it
- fascism \(\nRightarrow\) extreme regression
- tolerant/supportive of religion as a moral compass

## Lecture

- no one definition of fascism
- must imagine as _fascisms_
- fascism: righteous solution to problems of the time
- fascism: system of governance justifying genocide/crimes against humanity
